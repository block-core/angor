## Angor is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Bitcoin network. 
#### Think of it as a trustless, risk-minimized ICO.

With Angor, investors maintain complete control of their funds by locking coins into special timelock contracts until they need to be used.  
At any given point, investors can recover the funds that have not been released to the founders.
