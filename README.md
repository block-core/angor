    P2P Funding Protocol
</h3>

<br>

## What is Angor?

Angor is a Bitcoin funding protocol with two unique features:

1. Angor is **fully decentralized**, meaning there is no middleman involved in the investment process. Angor has no backend – the platform leverages the **Bitcoin network** for transaction processing, while **Nostr** is being used for decentralized storage of projects' metadata and direct communication with founders. Angor uses Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade for improved efficiency and privacy.

2. Bitcoin is released to the founders in **predetermined stages** via so-called time-lock contracts, allowing investors to **recover unspent funds at any time**. This framework provides investors with greater control, mitigates financial risk, and incentivizes founders to showcase tangible progress between stages.
